An on-the-fly GraphQL Schema generator from Eloquent models for Laravel.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Quickstart](#quickstart)
- [Model schemas](#model-schemas)

## Installation

This package requires PHP 7.2 and Laravel 6 or higher. To get started with Bakery, simply run:

```
composer require scrnhq/laravel-bakery
```

## Quickstart

After installing Bakery, publish the configuration and asserts using the `bakery:install` Artisan command.

```
php artisan bakery:install
```

After running this command, the configuration file should be located at `config/bakery.php`. The default
`App\Bakery\User` Bakery model schema refers to the `App\User` model.

You can find your new GraphQL API at `/graphql` and you can navigate to `/graphql/explore` to find GraphiQL, the
graphical interactive GraphQL IDE.

```gql
query {
  users {
    items {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## Model schemas

Model schemas are classes that lets you connect your Eloquent models with the GraphQL API. In there you can define which fields are available, which of them can be mutated and much more.

By default, Bakery model schema's are stored in the `app\Bakery` directory. You can generate a new model schema using
the handy `bakery:modelschema` Artisan command.

```
php artisan bakery:modelschema Post
```

The `model` property of a model schema defines which Eloquent model it corresponds to.

```php
/**
 * The model the schema corresponds to.
 *
 * @var string
 */
protected $model = \App\Post::class;
```

### Registering model schemas

> All model schema's in the `app/Bakery` directory will automatically be registered by Bakery. If you choose to 
> store your model schema's differently, you need to define and register your schema manually.

**You are not required to manually define and register a Schema. You can skip this step if you do not wish to
manually register a schema.**

In order to make model schemas available within GraphQL, they must be registered in a Schema. First you must create
a new `Schema` class. Next, you should set the `schema` item in the `config/bakery.php` file to the newly created
Schema.

There are two ways to manually registering model schemas in Bakery. You can use the `modelsIn` method in the schema
to load all models schemas in a given directory, or you can manually return an array of models schemas.
 
```php
namespace App\Support;

use Bakery\Support\Schema as BaseSchema;

class Schema extends BaseSchema
{
    /*
     * Get the models for the schema.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function models()
    {
        return $this->modelsIn(app_path('Bakery'));
        
        // Or, manually.
        return [
            App\Bakery\User::class,
            App\Bakery\Post::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

Now that you have created and registered your model schemas with Bakery, you can browse to `/graphql/explore` and query
your models in the interactive playground GraphQL.

```gql
query {
  posts {
    items {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

If everything is set up properly you will get a collection of posts in your database. You can also use GraphQL to
retrieve a single post.

```gql
query {
  posts(id: "1") {
    id
  }
}
```

Just like Laravel, Bakery follows naming conventions. It uses Laravel's pluralization library to transform your model
into queries so you can fetch an individual Post with `post` and a collection of Posts with `posts`.

### Fields

Now, each Bakery model schema contains a `fields` that return an array of fields, which extend the
`\Bakery\Fields\Field` class. To add a field to model schema, simply add it to `fields` method, where the key of
the item must match the name of the model `attribute`.

```php
use Bakery\Field;

/**
 * Get the fields for the schema.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function fields(): array
{
    return [
        'title' => Field::string(),
    ];
}
```

Now you can query the title of the posts in GraphQL.

```gql
query {
  post(id: "1") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

#### Field Types

Bakery has the following fields available:

- [Boolean](#boolean)
- [Float](#float)
- [ID](#id)
- [Int](#int)
- [String](#string)

##### Boolean
```php
Field::boolean()
```

##### Float
```php
Field::float()
```

##### ID
```php
Field::ID()
```

##### Int
```php
Field::int()
```

##### String
```php
Field::string()
```

### Relations

In addition to the fields described above, Bakery supports Eloquent relationships, too. To add a relationship to the
model schema, simply add it to the `relations` method, where the key of the item must match the relation name. Let's
say a `User` model `hasMany` `Post` models. Then you would define your Bakery model schema's like so:

`app\Bakery\User.php`

```php
use Bakery\Field;
use App\Bakery\Post;

/**
 * Get the fields for the schema.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function relations()
{
    return [
        'posts' => Field::collection(Post::class),
    ];
}
```

The inverse of the previous relation is that a `Post` model `belongsTo` a `User` model. The Bakery model schema
would be defined like so:

`app\Bakery\Post.php`

```php
use Bakery\Field;
use App\Bakery\User;

/**
 * Get the fields for the schema.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function relations()
{
    return [
        'user' => Field::model(User::class),
    ];
}
```

This way you can get all posts related to a user within a single GraphQL query.

```gql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Another key feature of GraphQL that Bakery fully supports are mutations. Bakery automatically creates the `create`,
`update`, and `delete` mutations for each registered model. Bakery also seamlessly uses Laravel's policies to
authorize the actions of your users.

> Having policies for your models is required for Bakery mutations to work. See 
> https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/authorization for more information.

For example, with the model schemas mentioned above, you could create a `Post` with a simple GraphQL mutation.

```gql
mutation {
  createPost(input: {
    title: "Hello world!"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```
