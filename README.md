## Version Compatibility

| Laravel | Bakery |
| :------ | :----- |
| 5.4.x   | 1.0.x  |
| 5.5.x   | 1.0.x  |
| 5.6.x   | 2.0.x  |
| 5.7.x   | 2.0.x  |

## Installation

Install via composer:

```
composer require scrnhq/laravel-bakery
```

or require in _composer.json_:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "scrnhq/laravel-bakery": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

then run `composer update` in your terminal to install Bakery.

Once this has finished, you will need to add the service provider to the providers array in your `app.php` config as follows:

**This package supports Laravel's package auto-discovery; if you are using Laravel 5.5 or above you can skip this step.**

```php
Bakery\BakeryServiceProvider::class,
```

## Quickstart

First publish the configuration file of Bakery by running the following command in your terminal:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bakery\BakeryServiceProvider"
```

Now open up `config/bakery.php` and you will see a `model` property that contains an empty array. Here you can start adding the models you want Bakery to handle.

```php
return [
    'models' => [
        App\User::class,
    ],
];
```

Next, add the `Introspectable` trait to that model.

```diff
<?php

namespace App;

use Bakery\Eloquent\Introspectable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;
+   use Introspectable;

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email', 'password',
    ];

    /**
     * The attributes that should be hidden for arrays.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $hidden = [
        'password', 'remember_token',
    ];
}
```

The `Introspectable` trait gives Bakery the power to introspect your model and query it's collection or individual models.

### Queries

To test this out, open up your Laravel application and go to `/graphiql`. Here you will see an interactive playground to execute GraphQL queries and mutations. Now execute the following query (assuming you have made your User model introspectable):

```gql
query {
  users {
    items {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

If everything is set up properly you will get a collection of users in your database! Now to fetch an individual user you can execute the following query:

```gql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id
  }
}
```

Just like Laravel, Bakery follows certain naming conventions. It uses Laravel's pluralization library to transform your model name in to queries so you can fetch an individual user by _user_ and a collection of users by _users_.

### Fields

One of the differences between GraphQL and Eloquent is that GraphQL is a little bit stricter when it comes to defining its schemas than Laravel is to defining its models. To create the types and queries you need to tell us a little bit about which attributes on your model you want to expose! These attributes are called `fields` in GraphQL and you can define them by that name on your model like so:

```diff
<?php

namespace App;

+ use GraphQL\Type\Definition\Type;
use Bakery\Eloquent\Introspectable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{

+    public function fields()
+    {
+        return [
+            'email' => Type::string();
+        ];
+    }

}
```

This tells Bakery that there is an email field on the model with the type string. [Here you can see a full overview and documentation of the underlying GraphQL type system](http://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/type-system/).

Now you are able to query email addresses from your query, like so:

```gql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id
    email
  }
}
```

### Relations

Bakery is also capable of returning data of other models related to the model you are querying. Let's say a user has articles, so you have defined a relationship on the model like so:

`User.php`

```php
public function articles()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Article::class);
}
```

`Article.php`

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use GraphQL\Type\Definition\Type;
use Bakery\Eloquent\Introspectable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Article extends Model
{

    public function fields()
    {
        return [
            'title' => Type::string();
        ];
    }
}
```

Now we need to tell Bakery about this new article model by updating the config.

`config/bakery.php`

```diff
return [
    'models' => [
        App\User::class,
+       App\Article::class,
    ],
];
```

Once you have set up your relationship in Eloquent, you just need to define it so that Bakery knows about it by setting the relations field on your user model:

`User.php`

```php
public function relations()
{
    return [
        'articles' => Type::listOf(Bakery::type('Article'))
    ];
}
```

Now you can easily fetch all the articles from a user in a single query like so:

```gql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id
    articles {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
